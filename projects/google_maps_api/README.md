## Berlin What to do this Weekend?

Application developed as part of the Udacity front-end developer nanodegree.

Shows users a list of events happening at specific points of the city. When click on the event, extra information is displayed.
The information of the events is taken from [Berlin Wochenendtipp](https://www.berlin.de/wochenend-tipps/) (in German). I have translated some of the entries to English.
